    system: Keep key focus when switching between alternatives
    
    When switching between alternatives in AltSwitcher, the currently
    visible child is replaced with the alternative. If the original
    child has the key focus when it is removed from the stage, the
    focus is lost. Detect this case and manually move the focus to
    the new child.
